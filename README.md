##Predicting Boston House Prices

The goal of this project is to evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a _good fit_ could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. 

Additionaly model is evaluated for being valuable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

Model is build based on the Scikit-Learn Python library using Decision Tree algorithm with techniques such as Grid Search, Cross-validation and R2 as perfomance metric.

The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:
